The first chatbot came in 1966 which was developed by Joseph Weizenbaum. 
# Types

  Uses Machine learning and AI algorithms to save the input from the user and use them later

With increased responses, the accuracy will be increased and the program also selects the closest matching response from the closest matching statement that matches the input.
# Limitations in a chatbot
  1. Domain knowledge (since true AI is still out of reach)
  2. Personality (not being able to respond correctly)
